					<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Stack Overflow is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network,[4][5][6] created in
					2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.[7][8] It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in
					computer programming.[9][10][11] It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer sites
					such as Experts-Exchange. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror,
					Atwood&apos;s popular programming blog.</p>

					<h3>Quora</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Quora is a question-and-answer site where questions are asked, answered, edited, and organized by its community
					of users in the form of opinions. Its publisher, Quora Inc., is based in Mountain View, California. The company
					was founded in June 2009, and the website was made available to the public on June 21, 2010.[5] Users can
					collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to answers that have been submitted by other users.[6] In
					September 2018, Quora reported hitting 300 million monthly users.[7] Users on Quora are known for written long,
					blog post-like answers.</p>

					<h3>Slack</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Here at MakeUseOf, Slack has been one of our primary modes of communication for almost an entire year — and it
					has proven invaluable for easier project management. The best way to describe it is IRC 2.0: the same core
					chatting functionality as IRC but with lots of extra bells and whistles on top.</p>
				<p>
					If your project team is still using IRC for communication, I highly recommend that you consider switching to
					Slack. It’s web-based for convenience, but has official apps available for Android, iOS, and Mac. A Windows client
					is also in beta production.

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Github, which is officially the largest code host in the world at the time of this writing, exploded onto the
					scene in the late 2000s and became the de facto social networking site for programmers.</p>
				<p>
					It heavily encourages an open source mindset by making all code projects public by default and making it extremely
					easy to fork projects with a one-click button. All projects also come with a built-in wiki, task manager, and bug
					tracker.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want a private repository on Github, you need to pay. All paid plans support unlimited team members; the
					only reason to go up a tier is to increase the number of available private repositories.

					<h3>Gitter.IM</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Gitter is a wonderful social chatting tool for Github users. (The login system requires that you have and use a
					Github account.) It’s basically a contemporary web version of Internet Relay Chat: lots of different chatrooms you
					can join and converse in.

					Three types of chat channels exist: 1) channels tied to Github teams, 2) channels tied to Github repositories, and
					3) standalone channels created directly by users. Channels can be public or private, but private user channels
					require a Premium account for $2 per month.

					Gitter is new but constantly improving, so if you’re an avid Github user you should really give it a try.</p>

					<h3>Trello</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Many of the MakeUseOf Editors live and die by Trello‘s organizational features. Here’s how it works. You create
					boards (projects) and each board consists of multiple lists (categories) that are comprised of individual cards
					(tasks).</p>
				<p>Cards can be tagged with several pieces of information: due dates, participating members, color-coded labels,
					etc. Each card also has a comment system for task-specific discussion as well as the ability to host attachments.
					Top it off with a drag-and-drop interface for shuffling cards around and you get a fast and convenient way to stay
					organized.</p>
				<p>I personally don’t use Trello as often as I should, but I certainly see the appeal and utility of it. It’s a
					little overkill if all you need is a simple to-do list, but for more complex projects, it’s absolutely essential.</p>

					<h3>Todoist</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Todoist is fast. Other to-do lists I’ve used required multiple Submit buttons and per-task details just to add a
					single element to the list. With Todoist, you just have to type a sentence and press Enter. You can add more
					details if you want, but it’s never required.</p>
				<p>
					Free accounts are good enough for most people, but upgrading to Premium for $29 per year grants features like task
					reminders, custom filters, productivity tracking, automatic backups, project synchronization, and more.

				<p>Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /.) is a social news website that originally billed itself as "News for
					Nerds. Stuff that Matters". It features news stories on science, technology, and politics that are submitted and
					evaluated by site users and editors. Each story has a comments section attached to it where users can add online
					comments. The website was founded in 1997 by Hope College students Rob Malda, also known as "CmdrTaco", and
					classmate Jeff Bates, also known as "Hemos". In 2012, they sold it to[4] DHI Group, Inc. (i.e., Dice Holdings
					International, which created the Dice.com website for tech job seekers[5][6]). In January 2016, BizX acquired
					Slashdot Media, including both slashdot.org and SourceForge.</p>
